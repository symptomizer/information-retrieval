\"text\": \"<h2>Premature ejaculation</h2><p>Premature ejaculation is the most common ejaculation problem. It&#x27;s where the male ejaculates too quickly during sexual intercourse.</p><p>A study looking at 500 couples from 5 different countries found the average time taken to ejaculate during intercourse was around 5-and-a-half minutes. However, it&#x27;s up to each couple to decide if they\\u2019re happy with the time taken \\u2013 there&#x27;s no definition of how long sex should last.</p><p>Occasional episodes of premature ejaculation are common and are not a cause for concern. However, if you&#x27;re finding that around half of your attempts at sex result in premature ejaculation, it might help to get treatment.</p><h3>Causes of premature ejaculation\\u00a0</h3><p>Various psychological and physical factors can cause a man to suddenly experience premature ejaculation.</p><p>Common physical causes include:</p><ul><li><b>prostate problems</b></li><li><b>thyroid problems</b> \\u2013 an\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/overactive-thyroid-hyperthyroidism/\\\">overactive</a> or\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/underactive-thyroid-hypothyroidism/\\\">underactive thyroid gland</a></li><li><b>using recreational drugs</b></li></ul><p>Common psychological causes include:</p><ul><li><a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/clinical-depression/\\\"><b>depression</b></a></li><li><a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/understanding-stress/\\\"><b>stress</b></a></li><li><b>relationship problems</b></li><li><b>anxiety about sexual performance</b> (particularly at the start of a new relationship, or when a man has had previous problems with sexual performance)</li></ul><p>It&#x27;s possible, but less common,\\u00a0for a man to have always experienced premature ejaculation since becoming sexually active. A number of possible causes for this are:</p><ul><li><b>conditioning</b> \\u2013 it&#x27;s possible that early sexual experiences can influence future sexual behaviour. For example, if a teenager conditions himself to ejaculate quickly to avoid being caught masturbating, it may later be difficult to break the habit</li><li><b>a traumatic sexual experience</b> <b>from childhood</b> \\u2013\\u00a0this can range from being caught masturbating to sexual abuse</li><li><b>a strict upbringing and beliefs about sex</b></li><li><b>biological reasons</b> \\u2013 some men may find their penis is extra sensitive</li></ul><h3>Treating premature ejaculation</h3><p>There are a number of things you can try yourself before seeking medical help.</p><h4>Measures you can try yourself</h4><p>It can sometimes help to:</p><ul><li>masturbate an hour or 2 before having sex</li><li>use a thick condom to help decrease sensation</li><li>take a deep breath to briefly shut down the ejaculatory reflex (an automatic reflex of the body during which ejaculation occurs)</li><li>have sex with your partner on top (to allow them to pull away when you are close to ejaculating)</li><li>take breaks during sex and think about something boring</li></ul><h4>Couples therapy</h4><p>If you&#x27;re in a long-term relationship, you may benefit from having couples therapy. During these sessions, the therapist will:</p><ul><li>encourage couples to explore any relationship issues they have, and give them advice about resolving them</li><li>show the couple techniques that can help you\\u00a0&quot;unlearn&quot; the habit of premature ejaculation (the 2 most popular techniques are the &quot;squeeze&quot; and &quot;stop-go&quot; techniques)</li></ul><p>In the squeeze technique, your partner masturbates you, but stops before the point of ejaculation and squeezes the head of your penis for between 10 to 20 seconds. They then let go and wait for another 30 seconds before resuming masturbation. This process is carried out several times before ejaculation is allowed to occur.</p><p>The stop-go technique is similar, but your partner does not squeeze your penis. Once you feel more confident about delaying ejaculation, you and your partner can begin to have sex, stopping and starting as required.</p><p>These techniques may sound simple, but they require lots of practice.</p><h4>Antidepressants\\u00a0(SSRIs)</h4><p><a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/ssri-antidepressants/\\\">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</a> are designed to treat depression, but they also delay ejaculation.

However, you&#x27;ll usually need to take the medicine for 1 to 2 weeks before you notice the full effects.</p><p>Side effects of SSRIs are usually mild and should improve after 2 to 3 weeks.

Local NHS authorities can choose to prescribe it on the NHS.</p><p>It acts much faster than the SSRIs mentioned above and can be used &quot;on demand&quot;. You\\u2019ll usually be advised to take it between 1 and 3 hours before sex, but not more than once a day.</p><p>Your response to the treatment will then be reviewed after 4 weeks (or after 6), and again every 6 months.</p><p>Dapoxetine is not suitable for all men diagnosed with premature ejaculation. For example, it is not recommended for some men with heart, kidney and liver problems. It can also interact with other medicines, such as other antidepressants.</p><p>Common side effects include:</p><ul><li>headaches</li><li>dizziness</li><li>feeling sick</li></ul><h4>Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors</h4><p>Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil (sold as Viagra), are a class of medicine used to treat erectile dysfunction. Research has found that they may also help with premature ejaculation.</p><p>Because of changes in regulations, you no longer need a prescription to get sildenafil. But you will have to have a consultation with the pharmacist to make sure it&#x27;s safe for you to take it.</p><p>Read more about <a href=\\\"/medicines/sildenafil-viagra/\\\">sildenafil including information on how and when to take it</a>.</p><h4>Topical anaesthetics and condoms</h4><p>The use of topical anaesthetics such as lidocaine or prilocaine can help but may be transferred and absorbed to the vagina, causing decreased sensation.

Other causes are\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/diabetes/\\\">diabetes</a>,\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/multiple-sclerosis/\\\">multiple sclerosis</a>, and a class of medicines known as alpha blockers, which are often used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).</p><h3>Treating retrograde ejaculation</h3><p>Most men do not need treatment for retrograde ejaculation because they are still able to enjoy a healthy sex life and the condition does not have adverse effects on their health.</p><p>But if treatment is required (usually because of wanting to father a child), there are options to try.</p><p>For example,\\u00a0pseudoephedrine (commonly used as a decongestant) has proved effective in treating retrograde ejaculation caused by\\u00a0diabetes or surgery.</p><p>If retrograde ejaculation is caused by using a certain medicine, then normal ejaculation will usually return once medicine is stopped. Speak to your GP before stopping any prescribed medicine.</p><p>However, if the retrograde ejaculation has been caused by significant muscle or nerve damage, treatment may not be possible.</p><p>Men who want to have children can have sperm taken from their urine for use in\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/artificial-insemination/\\\">artificial insemination</a> or <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/ivf/\\\">in-vitro fertilisation (IVF)</a>.</p>\", \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"name\": \"markdown\"}]}, {\"identifier\": \"0\", \"name\": \"section heading\", \"position\": 4, \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"headline\": \"\", \"text\": \"Involve your partner\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": [{\"position\": 0, \"identifier\": \"1\", \"text\": \"<h2>Involve your partner</h2><p>If you&#x27;re having problems with your sex life and are seeking treatment, it is usually recommended you involve your partner as much as possible.</p><p>Communicating your concerns can often go a long way to helping to resolve them.

These charts are called Snellen or LogMAR charts.</p>\\n<p>For younger children, a similar test using pictures or symbols may be carried out instead.</p>\\n<h3>Range of movement tests</h3>\\n<p>To test the range of movement of each eye, a child's attention will be drawn to an interesting object, which is then moved to 8 different positions: up, down, left, right, and halfway between each of these points. </p>\\n<p>This tests how well the eye muscles work.</p>\\n<h3>Refraction test</h3>\\n<p>A refraction test is carried out by an optometrist at a high-street opticians and is used to check if your child needs glasses and, if so, what prescription they need.</p>\\n<p>Before the test, your child may be given special eyedrops that widen their pupils so the back of their\\u00a0eyes can be examined more clearly. </p>\\n<p>Your child will be asked to\\u00a0look at a light, or read letters on a chart if they're old enough, while different lenses are placed in front of their eyes.</p>\\n<h3>Colour\\u00a0vision deficiency\\u00a0test</h3>\\n<p>Colour vision deficiency tests, also known as colour blindness tests,\\u00a0are usually carried out in older children if a problem is suspected.</p>\\n<p>One of the tests used to check for colour blindness is the Ishihara test.

One is placed close to the nerve supplying the muscle and the other over the centre of the muscle.</p>\\n<p>Leads connect the electrodes to a\\u00a0battery-operated stimulator, which is the size of a pack of cards and worn on a belt or kept\\u00a0in a pocket.</p>\\n<p>The stimulator produces electrical impulses that stimulate the nerves to shorten  (contract) the affected muscles. </p>\\n<p>The stimulator is triggered by a sensor in the shoe and is\\u00a0activated every time your heel leaves the ground as you walk.</p>\\n<p>If your GP or consultant thinks you'll benefit from using an electrical stimulation device, you'll be referred to\\u00a0an orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeon for an assessment. </p>\\n<p>You may then be referred to a specialist unit to\\u00a0try the device and assess its suitabilty.</p>\\n<p>For long-term use, it may be possible to have an operation to implant the electrodes under your skin. </p>\\n<p>The procedure involves positioning the electrodes over the affected nerve while you're under <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/general-anaesthesia/\\\">general anaesthetic</a>.</p>\\n<p>The\\u00a0National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advises that electrical stimulation can be used to treat people with foot drop caused by damage to the brain or spinal cord,\\u00a0provided:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>the person understands what's

procedure\\u00a0usually involves transferring a tendon from the stronger leg muscles to the muscle that should be pulling your ankle upwards.</p>\\n<p>Another type of surgery involves fusing the foot or ankle bones to help stabilise the ankle.</p>\\n<p>Speak to your GP or orthopaedic foot and ankle specialist if you're thinking about having surgery for foot drop. </p>\\n<p>They'll be able to give

Support their chest with 1 hand. Lean the person forward so the object blocking their airway will come out of their mouth, rather than moving further down. </li>\\n<li>Give up to 5 sharp blows between the person's shoulder blades with the heel of your hand (the heel is between the palm of your hand and your wrist). </li>\\n<li>Check if the blockage has cleared. </li>\\n<li>If not, give up to 5 abdominal thrusts. </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Do not give abdominal thrusts to babies under 1 year old or to pregnant women.</strong></p>\\n<p>To perform abdominal thrusts on a person who is severely choking and isn't in one of the above groups:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Stand behind the person who is choking. </li>\\n<li>Place your arms around their waist and bend them well forward. </li>\\n<li>Clench 1 fist and place it just above the person's belly button. </li>\\n<li>Place your other hand on top of your fist and pull sharply inwards and upwards. </li>\\n<li>Repeat this up to 5 times. </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The aim is to get the obstruction out with each chest thrust, rather than necessarily doing all 5.</p>\\n<p><strong>If the person's airway is still blocked after trying back blows and abdominal thrusts:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Tell the 999 operator that the person is choking.</strong></li>\\n<li><strong>Continue with the cycles of 5 back blows and 5 abdominal thrusts until help arrives.</strong></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The person choking should always be seen by a healthcare professional afterwards to check for any injuries or small pieces of the obstruction that remain.</p>\\n<h3>Drowning</h3>\\n<p>If someone is in difficulty in water, don't enter the water unless it's safe to do so. Don't put yourself at risk.</p>\\n<p>Once the person is on land, you need to check if they're breathing. Ask someone to call 999 for medical help.</p>\\n<p>If they're not breathing, open the airway and give 5 initial rescue breaths before starting CPR. </p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/first-aid/cpr/\\\">Find out how to give CPR</a>, including rescue breaths.</p>\\n<p>If the person is unconscious but still breathing, put them into the <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/first-aid/recovery-position/\\\">recovery position</a> with their head lower than their body and call an ambulance immediately.</p>\\n<p>Continue watching the patient to ensure they don't stop breathing and continue to breathe normally.</p>\\n<h3>Electric shock (domestic)</h3>\\n<p>If someone has had an electric shock, switch off the electrical current at the mains to break the contact between the person and the electrical supply.</p>\\n<p>If you can't reach the mains supply:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Do not go near or touch the person until you're sure the electrical supply has been switched off.</li>\\n<li>Once the power supply has been switched off, and\\u00a0if the person isn't breathing,\\u00a0dial 999 or 112 to for an\\u00a0ambulance. </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Afterwards, seek medical help.</p>\\n<h3>Fractures</h3>\\n<p>It can be difficult to tell if a person has a broken bone or a joint, as opposed to a simple muscular injury. If you're in any doubt, treat\\u00a0the injury\\u00a0as a broken bone.</p>\\n<p>If the person is unconscious or is bleeding heavily, these must be dealt with first by controlling\\u00a0the bleeding with direct pressure and <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/first-aid/cpr/\\\">performing CPR</a>. See the section on bleeding on this page.</p>\\n<p>If the person is conscious, prevent any further pain or damage\\u00a0by keeping the fracture as still as possible until you get them safely to hospital.</p>\\n<p>Once you have done this, decide whether the best way to get them to hospital is by ambulance or car. </p>\\n<p>If the pain isn't too severe, you could transport them to hospital by car. Get someone else to drive if possible so you can care for the casualty during the trip.</p>\\n<p>But call 999 if:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>they're in a lot of pain and in need of strong painkilling medication \\u2013 call an ambulance and do not move them </li>\\n<li>it's obvious they have a broken leg \\u2013 do not move them, but\\u00a0keep them in the position you\\u00a0found them in and call an ambulance </li>\\n<li>you suspect they have injured or broken their back \\u2013 call an ambulance and do not move them </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Do not give the casualty anything to eat or drink as they may

href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/\\\">heart attack</a> is one of the most common life-threatening heart conditions in the UK.</p>\\n<p><strong>If you think someone is having or has had a heart attack, call 999 and then move them into a comfortable sitting position.</strong></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/symptoms/\\\">Symptoms of a heart attack</a> include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>chest pain \\u2013 the pain is usually located in the centre or left side of the chest and can feel like a sensation of pressure, tightness or squeezing </li>\\n<li>pain in other parts of the body \\u2013 it can feel as if the pain is travelling from\\u00a0the chest down 1 or both arms, or into the jaw, neck, back or abdomen (tummy)\\u00a0 </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Sit the person down and make them comfortable.</p>\\n<p>If they're conscious, reassure them and ask them to take a 300mg aspirin tablet to chew slowly (unless you know they shouldn't take aspirin\\u00a0\\u2013 for example,\\u00a0if\\u00a0they're under 16 or allergic to it).</p>\\n<p>If the person has any medication for <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/angina/\\\">angina</a>, such as a spray or tablets, help them to take it. </p>\\n<p>Monitor their vital signs, such as breathing,\\u00a0until help arrives.</p>\\n<p>If the person deteriorates and becomes unconscious, <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/first-aid/after-an-accident/\\\">open their airway</a>, check their breathing and, if\\u00a0necessary, start <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/first-aid/cpr/\\\">CPR</a>.\\u00a0</p>\\n<p><strong>Call 999 to tell them the patient is now in cardiac arrest.</strong></p>\\n<h3>Poisoning</h3>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/poisoning/\\\">Poisoning</a>\\u00a0is potentially life threatening. </p>\\n<p>Most cases of\\u00a0poisoning in the UK happen when a person has\\u00a0swallowed a toxic substance, such as bleach, taken an overdose of a prescription medication, or eaten\\u00a0wild plants and fungi.\\u00a0</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/alcohol-poisoning/\\\">Alcohol poisoning</a> can cause similar symptoms.</p>\\n<p><strong>If you think someone has swallowed a poisonous substance, call 999 to get immediate medical help and advice.</strong></p>\\n<p>The effects of poisoning depend on the substance swallowed, but can include vomiting, loss of consciousness, pain or a burning sensation. </p>\\n<p>The following advice is important:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Find out what's been swallowed so you can tell the paramedic or doctor. </li>\\n<li>Do not give the person anything to eat or drink unless a healthcare professional advises you to. </li>\\n<li>Do not try to\\u00a0cause\\u00a0vomiting. </li>\\n<li>Stay with the person, as their condition may get worse and they could\\u00a0become unconscious. </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>If the person becomes unconscious while you're waiting for help to arrive, check for breathing and, if necessary,\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/first-aid/cpr/\\\">perform CPR</a>.</p>\\n<p>Do not perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation if the casualty's mouth or airway is contaminated with the poison.</p>\\n<p>Do not leave them if they're unconscious: they could vomit. The vomit could then enter their lungs and make them choke.</p>\\n<p>If they do vomit naturally, try to collect some of it for the ambulance crew \\u2013 this may help identify the cause of the poisoning.</p>\\n<p>If the patient is conscious and breathing normally, put\\u00a0them into the\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/first-aid/recovery-position/\\\">recovery position</a> and keep checking they're breathing normally.</p>\\n<p>Read more about <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/poisoning/treatment/\\\">treating someone who's been poisoned</a>\\u00a0and <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/alcohol-poisoning/\\\">treating alcohol poisoning</a>.</p>\\n<h3>Shock</h3>\\n<p>In the case of a serious injury or illness, it's important to look out for signs of shock.</p>\\n<p>Shock is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the circulatory system fails\\u00a0to provide enough oxygenated blood to the body and, as a result, deprives the vital organs of oxygen.</p>\\n<p>This is usually the result of severe blood loss, but it can also occur after severe burns, severe vomiting, a heart attack, a bacterial infection, or a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).</p>\\n<p>The type of shock described here isn't the same as the emotional response of feeling shocked, which can also occur after an accident. </p>\\n<p>Signs of shock include: </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>pale, cold, clammy skin </li>\\n<li>sweating </li>\\n<li>rapid, shallow breathing </li>\\n<li>weakness and dizziness </li>\\n<li>feeling sick and possibly vomiting </li>\\n<li>thirst </li>\\n<li>yawning </li>\\n<li>sighing </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Seek medical help immediately if\\u00a0you notice that someone has any of the above\\u00a0signs of shock. </p>\\n<p>If they do, you should:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>call 999 as soon as possible and ask for an ambulance </li>\\n<li>treat any obvious injuries </li>\\n<li>lie the person down if their injuries allow you to and, if possible, raise and support their legs </li>\\n<li>use a coat or blanket to keep them warm </li>\\n<li>do not give them anything to eat or drink </li>\\n<li>give them lots of comfort and reassurance </li>\\n<li>monitor the person\\u00a0\\u2013 if they stop breathing, start <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/first-aid/cpr/\\\">CPR</a>\\u00a0and call 999 </li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Stroke</h3>\\n<p>The <strong>FAST</strong> guide is the most important thing to remember when dealing with people who have had a <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/stroke/\\\">stroke</a>. </p>\\n<p>The earlier they receive treatment, the better. Call for emergency medical help straight away. </p>\\n<p>If you think a person has had a stroke, use the <strong>FAST</strong> guide:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Face</strong> \\u2013 the face may have dropped on 1 side, the person may not be able to smile, or their mouth or eye may have drooped.</li>\\n<li><strong>Arms</strong> \\u2013 the person with suspected stroke may not be able to lift both arms and keep them there because of weakness or numbness in 1 arm.</li>\\n<li><strong>Speech</strong> \\u2013 their speech may be slurred or garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all despite appearing to be awake.</li>\\n<li><strong>Time</strong> \\u2013 it's time to dial 999 immediately if you notice any of these signs or symptoms. </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Read more about the <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/stroke/symptoms/\\\">symptoms of a stroke</a>.</p>\\n\", \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"name\": \"markdown\"}]}, {\"identifier\": \"0\", \"name\": \"section heading\", \"position\": 3, \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"headline\": null, \"text\": \"Getting help in an emergency\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": [{\"position\": 0, \"identifier\": \"1\", \"text\": \"<h2>Getting help in an emergency</h2>\\n<p>In the UK,\\u00a0999 has been the emergency services number\\u00a0for many years.</p>\\n<p>But you can now also call 112 to get help, which is the single emergency telephone number for the EU. </p>\\n<p>This number will give you access to the emergency services wherever you are in the EU.</p>\\n<p>When you call 999 or 112, you'll be asked what service you need, as well as: </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>your telephone number </li>\\n<li>the address you're calling from\\u00a0 </li>\\n<li>a brief description of what's wrong with the casualty and whether they're\\u00a0bleeding,\\u00a0unconscious or not breathing </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The call handler may advise you on how to assist the casualty until help arrives.</p>\\n\", \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"name\": \"markdown\"}]}], \"alternativeHeadline\": \"Overview\"}", "Farting (flatulence)": "{\"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"MedicalWebPage\", \"name\": \"Farting (flatulence)\", \"copyrightHolder\": {\"name\": \"Crown Copyright\", \"@type\": \"Organization\"}, \"license\": \"https://developer.api.nhs.uk/terms\", \"author\": {\"url\": \"https://www.nhs.uk\", \"logo\": \"https://www.nhs.uk/nhscwebservices/documents/logo1.jpg\", \"email\": \"nhswebsite.servicedesk@nhs.net\", \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"NHS website\"}, \"about\": {\"@type\": \"MedicalCondition\", \"name\": \"Farting (flatulence)\", \"alternateName\": [\"Wind\"]}, \"description\": \"Flatulence is passing gas from the digestive system out of the back passage.

Medicine or radiotherapy may sometimes be\\u00a0needed\\u00a0after, or instead of, surgery.</p><h3>Surgery</h3><p>Surgery is usually effective and can\\u00a0completely cure acromegaly. But sometimes the tumour is too large to be removed entirely, and you may need another operation or further treatment with medicine or radiotherapy.</p><p>Under <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/general-anaesthesia/\\\">general anaesthetic</a>, the surgeon will make a small cut inside your nose or behind your upper lip to access the pituitary gland.</p><p>A long, thin, flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end, called an <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/endoscopy/\\\">endoscope</a>, is fed into the opening so your doctor can see the tumour. Surgical instruments are passed through the same opening and used to remove the tumour.</p><p>Removing the tumour should instantly lower your levels of growth hormone and relieve pressure on the surrounding tissue. Facial features often start to return to normal and swelling improves within a few days.</p><p>With surgery, there&#x27;s risk of:</p><ul><li>damaging the healthy parts of your pituitary gland</li><li>leakage of the fluid that surrounds and protects your brain</li><li><a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/meningitis/\\\">meningitis</a> \\u2013 although this is rare</li></ul><p>Your surgeon will discuss these risks with you and answer any questions you have.</p><h3>Medicine</h3><p>Medicine may be prescribed if your growth hormone levels are still higher than normal after surgery, or if surgery was not possible.</p><p>3 different types of medicine are used:</p><ul><li><b>a\\u00a0monthly injection of either octreotide, lanreotide or pasireotide</b> \\u2013 this slows down the release of growth hormone and can sometimes also shrink tumours</li><li><b>a\\u00a0daily pegvisomant injection</b> \\u2013 this blocks the effects of growth hormone and\\u00a0can significantly improve symptoms</li><li><b>bromocriptine or cabergoline tablets</b> \\u2013 these can stop growth hormone being produced, but they only work in a small proportion of people</li></ul><p>Each of these medicines has different advantages and disadvantages. Speak to your doctor about the options available to you, and the benefits and risks of each.</p><h3>Radiotherapy</h3><p>If surgery is not possible,\\u00a0or not all of\\u00a0the tumour could be removed, or if medicine has not worked, you may be offered <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/radiotherapy/\\\">radiotherapy</a>.</p><p>This can eventually reduce your growth hormone levels, but it may not have a noticeable effect for several years and you may need to take medicine in the meantime.</p><p>2 main types of radiotherapy are used to treat acromegaly:</p><ul><li><b>stereotactic radiotherapy</b> \\u2013 a high-dose beam of radiation is aimed very precisely at your adenoma; you&#x27;ll need to wear a rigid head frame or a plastic mask to hold your head still during the treatment, which can usually be done in one session</li><li><b>conventional radiotherapy</b> \\u2013 this also\\u00a0uses a\\u00a0beam of radiation to target the adenoma, but it&#x27;s wider and less precise than the one used\\u00a0in stereotactic radiotherapy; this means this treatment can damage the surrounding pituitary gland and brain tissue, so it&#x27;s given in small doses over 4 to 6 weeks to\\u00a0give your tissues time to heal between treatments</li></ul><p>Stereotactic radiotherapy is more commonly used to treat adenomas because it minimises the risk of damage to nearby healthy tissue.</p><p>Radiotherapy can have a number of side effects. It will often cause a gradual drop in the levels of other hormones produced by your pituitary gland, so you&#x27;ll usually need\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt/\\\">hormone replacement therapy</a> for the rest of your life. It may also have an effect on your fertility.</p><p>Your doctor will be able to talk to you about these risks and other possible side effects.</p><h3>Follow-up</h3><p>Treatment is often effective at stopping the excessive production of growth hormone and improving the symptoms of acromegaly.</p><p>After treatment, you&#x27;ll need regular follow-up appointments with your specialist for the rest of your life. These will be used to monitor how well your pituitary gland is working, check you&#x27;re on the correct hormone replacement treatment and make sure the condition does not return.</p>\", \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"name\": \"markdown\"}]}, {\"identifier\": \"0\", \"name\": \"section heading\", \"position\": 5, \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"headline\": \"Diagnosing acromegaly\", \"text\": \"\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": [{\"position\": 0, \"identifier\": \"1\", \"text\": \"<p>Because the symptoms of acromegaly often develop gradually over several years, you may not get a diagnosis straight away.

The device is turned on using a handheld external control.</p>\\n<p>The effectiveness of this treatment can vary considerably. Not everyone will respond to it, and for many people who do respond, the effect will largely wear off within 12 months. This means electrical stimulation is not suitable for everyone with gastroparesis.</p>\\n<p>There's also a small chance of this procedure leading to complications that would require removing the device,\\u00a0such as: </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>infection </li>\\n<li>the device dislodging and moving </li>\\n<li>a hole forming in your stomach wall </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Speak to your surgeon about the possible risks. You can also read the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on <a href=\\\"https://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/IPG489\\\" title=\\\"External website\\\">gastroelectrical stimulation for gastroparesis</a>.</p>\\n<h3>Botulinum toxin injections</h3>\\n<p>More severe cases of gastroparesis may occasionally be treated by injecting botulinum toxin into the valve between your stomach and small intestine. </p>\\n<p>This relaxes the valve\\u00a0and keeps it open for a longer period of time so food can pass through.</p>\\n<p>The injection is given through a thin, flexible tube (endoscope) which is passed down your throat and into your stomach.</p>\\n<p>This is a fairly new treatment and some studies have found it may not be very effective, so it's not recommended by all doctors.</p>\\n<h3>A feeding tube</h3>\\n<p>If you have extremely severe gastroparesis that is not improved with dietary changes or medicine, a feeding tube may be recommended.</p>\\n<p>Many different types of temporary and permanent feeding tube are available.</p>\\n<p>A temporary feeding tube, called a nasojejunal tube, may be offered to you first. This is inserted into your digestive tract through your nose and delivers nutrients directly into your small intestine. </p>\\n<p>A feeding tube can also be inserted into your bowel through a cut (incision) made in your tummy. This is known as a jejunostomy. </p>\\n<p>Liquid food can be delivered through the tube, which goes straight to your bowel to be absorbed, bypassing your stomach.</p>\\n<p>Speak to your doctor about the risks and benefits of each type of feeding tube.</p>\\n<p>An alternative feeding method for severe gastroparesis is intravenous (parenteral) nutrition. This is where liquid nutrients are delivered into your bloodstream\\u00a0through a catheter\\u00a0inserted into a large vein.</p>\\n<h3>Surgery</h3>\\n<p>Some people may benefit from having an operation to insert a tube into the stomach through the tummy (abdomen). This tube can be periodically opened to release gas and relieve bloating.</p>\\n<p>A surgical\\u00a0procedure may be recommended as a last resort to either:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>create a new opening between your stomach and small intestine (gastroenterostomy) </li>\\n<li>connect your stomach directly to the second part of your small intestine, called the jejunum (gastrojejunostomy) </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>These operations may reduce your symptoms by allowing food to move through your stomach more easily.</p>\\n<p>Your doctor can explain whether any procedures are suitable for you, and can discuss the possible risks involved.</p>\\n\", \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"name\": \"markdown\"}]}, {\"identifier\": \"0\", \"name\": \"section heading\", \"position\": 6, \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"headline\": \"\", \"text\": \"Advice for people with diabetes\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": [{\"position\": 0, \"identifier\": \"1\", \"text\": \"<h2>Advice for people with diabetes</h2>\\n<p>Having gastroparesis means your food is being digested slowly and at unpredictable times.

of the stomach is removed </li>\\n<li>sleeve gastrectomy \\u2013 the left side of the stomach is removed </li>\\n<li>oesophagogastrectomy \\u2013 the top part of the stomach and part of the oesophagus (gullet), the tube connecting your throat to your stomach, is removed </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The top of the stomach is connected to the gullet, the bottom of the stomach to the first part of the small intestine (duodenum), and the gullet to either the small intestine or the remaining section of stomach.

Your baby will be taught to link the sound to a visual reward such as a toy or computer screen lighting up.</p><p>Once your child is able to associate the sound and the visual reward the volume and pitch of the sound will be varied to determine the quietest sounds your child is able to hear.</p><h4>Play audiometry</h4><p>Young children between 1.5 and 5 years old may have a play audiometry test.</p><p>During the test, sounds will be played through headphones or speakers and your child will be asked to perform a simple task when they hear the sound. This may vary from putting a ball in a bucket to completing a puzzle.</p><p>As with VRA, the volume and pitch of the sound will be varied to determine the quietest sounds your child is able to hear.</p><h4>Pure tone audiometry</h4><p>Older children may have a test called pure tone audiometry. This is the test often used to screen a child&#x27;s hearing before they start school, when it is sometimes referred to as the &quot;sweep test&quot;. It&#x27;s similar to a hearing test an adult might have.</p><p>During pure tone audiometry,\\u00a0a\\u00a0machine generates sounds at different volumes and frequencies. The sounds are played through headphones and your child is asked to respond when they hear them\\u00a0by pressing a button.</p><p>By\\u00a0changing the level of the sound, the tester can work out the quietest sounds your\\u00a0child can hear.</p><h4>Bone conduction test</h4><p>In addition to using speakers or headphones, most of the tests above can also be carried out using a small vibrating device placed behind the ear.</p><p>This device\\u00a0passes sound directly to the inner ear through the bones in the head, which can help\\u00a0identify which part of the ear is not working properly if\\u00a0your child is having hearing problems.</p><h4>Tympanometry</h4><p>Tympanometry is a\\u00a0test to assess how flexible the eardrum is.</p><p>For good hearing, your eardrum needs to be flexible to allow sound to pass through it. If the eardrum is too rigid\\u00a0\\u2013\\u00a0for example, because there is fluid behind it\\u00a0(<a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/glue-ear/\\\">glue ear</a>) \\u2013\\u00a0sounds will bounce back off the eardrum instead of passing through it.</p><p>During the test, a\\u00a0soft rubber tube will be\\u00a0placed at the entrance\\u00a0of your child&#x27;s\\u00a0ear.\\u00a0Air is\\u00a0gently blown down the tube and a sound is played through a small speaker inside it.

In the early stages, it may be controlled with medicine. Surgery may be required in severe or persistent cases. The treatments are outlined below.</p>\\n<h3>Antibiotics</h3>\\n<p>If you have lumps that are particularly painful, inflamed and oozing pus, you may be prescribed a 1- or 2-week course of antibiotic tablets, as you may have an infection. However, in hidradenitis suppurativa, a secondary bacterial infection is not that common, so a swab of the affected area should be taken.</p>\\n<p>If bacterial infection is not present, low doses of <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/antibiotics/\\\">antibiotics</a> may be used to prevent inflammation. This longer course of antibiotics will last at least 3 months, with the aim being to reduce the number of lumps that develop.</p>\\n<p>You may be given antibiotics as a cream (topical) or as a tablet, capsule or liquid that you drink. Antibiotic types can include <a href=\\\"/medicines/erythromycin/\\\">erythromycin</a>, <a href=\\\"/medicines/lymecycline/\\\">lymecycline</a>, <a href=\\\"/medicines/doxycycline/\\\">doxycycline</a> and tetracycline.</p>\\n<p>In severe cases of hidradenitis suppurativa, a combination of clindamycin and rifampicin can be effective, but these antibiotics are usually prescribed by dermatologists rather than GPs.</p>\\n<h3>Antiseptics</h3>\\n<p>Antiseptic washes, such as 4% chlorhexidine, applied daily to affected areas are often\\u00a0prescribed alongside other treatments.</p>\\n<h3>Retinoids</h3>\\n<p>Retinoids, such as\\u00a0isotretinoin and acitretin, are vitamin-A based medications. They're not as effective for treating\\u00a0hidradenitis suppurativa as they are for treating acne, but they may help some people.</p>\\n<p>Retinoids are always prescribed by dermatologists. They must\\u00a0be used with caution and cannot be taken during pregnancy.\\u00a0</p>\\n<h3>Contraceptives</h3>\\n<p>If hidradenitis suppurativa flares up before a <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/periods/\\\">period</a> you may benefit from taking the <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/combined-contraceptive-pill/\\\">combined contraceptive pill</a>.</p>\\n<h3>Immunosuppressive treatments (infliximab and adalimumab)</h3>\\n<p>In very severe cases of hidradenitis suppurativa, treatments that suppress the immune system, such as <a href=\\\"/medicines/adalimumab/\\\">adalimumab</a> (a biological therapy) can be useful.</p>\\n<p>However, there are risks associated with suppressing the immune system, so they're usually only prescribed by a dermatologist if other treatments do not work.</p>\\n<p>Infliximab and adalimumab are immunosuppressive treatments that are given by injection at regular intervals either at home or in hospital.</p>\\n<h3>Steroids</h3>\\n<p>Rarely, you may be prescribed steroids, such as <a href=\\\"/medicines/prednisolone/\\\">prednisolone</a>, to reduce severely inflamed skin. <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/steroids/\\\">Steroids</a> can be taken as tablets, or you may have an injection directly into affected skin.</p>\\n<p>Possible side effects of steroids include weight gain, poor sleep and mood swings.</p>\\n<p>Read more about the <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/steroid-tablets/#side-effects\\\">side effects of steroid tablets</a> and <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/steroid-injections/#side-effects\\\">steroid injections</a>.</p>\\n<h3>Surgery</h3>\\n<p>Surgery may be considered in cases where hidradenitis suppurativa can not be controlled with medicine.</p>\\n\", \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"name\": \"markdown\"}]}, {\"identifier\": \"0\", \"name\": \"section heading\", \"position\": 5, \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"headline\": \"\", \"text\": \"Lifestyle advice\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": [{\"position\": 0, \"identifier\": \"1\", \"text\": \"<h2>Lifestyle advice</h2>\\n<p>If you have hidradenitis suppurativa you should:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/live-well/healthy-weight/\\\">lose weight</a> if you are overweight</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/live-well/quit-smoking/\\\">stop smoking</a> if you smoke</li>\\n<li>use an antiseptic skin wash or antiseptic soap \\u2013 this may be prescribed alongside other treatment (see above) </li>\\n<li>hold a warm flannel on the lumps to encourage the pus to drain </li>\\n<li>wear loose fitting clothes </li>\\n<li>avoid shaving affected skin and avoid wearing perfume or perfumed deodorants in the affected areas</li>\\n</ul>\\n\", \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"name\": \"markdown\"}]}, {\"identifier\": \"0\", \"name\": \"section heading\", \"position\": 6, \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"headline\": \"\", \"text\": \"Outlook\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": [{\"position\": 0, \"identifier\": \"1\", \"text\": \"<h2>Outlook</h2>\\n<p>Although hidradenitis suppurativa can persist for many years, if it's diagnosed early the symptoms can be improved with treatment.</p>\\n<p>However, the condition can have a significant impact on a person's everyday life.

The balloon is then deflated and removed along with the catheter.</p><p>This procedure is generally less effective than replacing the mitral valve, but recovery tends to be quicker and it may be a better option if your valve is not too narrow or you&#x27;re at an increased risk of surgery complications (for example, if you&#x27;re pregnant or frail).</p>\", \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"name\": \"markdown\"}]}]}", "Neonatal herpes (herpes in a baby)": "{\"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"MedicalWebPage\", \"name\": \"Neonatal herpes (herpes in a baby)\", \"copyrightHolder\": {\"name\": \"Crown Copyright\", \"@type\": \"Organization\"}, \"license\": \"https://developer.api.nhs.uk/terms\", \"author\": {\"url\": \"https://www.nhs.uk\", \"logo\": \"https://www.nhs.uk/nhscwebservices/documents/logo1.jpg\", \"email\": \"nhswebsite.servicedesk@nhs.net\", \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"NHS website\"}, \"about\": {\"@type\": \"MedicalCondition\", \"name\": \"Neonatal herpes (herpes in a baby)\", \"alternateName\": [\"Herpes in babies\"]}, \"description\": \"Information on neonatal herpes (herpes in newborn babies), with links to other useful resources.\", \"url\": \"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/neonatal-herpes/\", \"lastReviewed\": [\"2018-07-27T14:06:00+00:00\", \"2021-07-27T14:06:00+00:00\"], \"breadcrumb\": {\"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"BreadcrumbList\", \"itemListElement\": [{\"@type\": \"ListItem\", \"position\": 0, \"item\": {\"@id\": \"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/\", \"name\": \"Health A to Z\", \"genre\": \"condition\"}}, {\"@type\": \"ListItem\", \"position\": 1, \"item\": {\"@id\": \"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/neonatal-herpes/\", \"name\": \"Neonatal herpes (herpes in a baby)\", \"genre\": \"condition\"}}]}, \"dateModified\": \"2020-09-03T11:06:30+00:00\", \"genre\": \"condition\", \"hasPart\": [], \"relatedLink\": [{\"@type\": \"LinkRole\", \"url\": \"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/neonatal-herpes/\", \"linkRelationship\": \"Navigation\", \"position\": 0, \"name\": \"Neonatal herpes (herpes in a baby)\"}], \"keywords\": [], \"mainEntityOfPage\": [{\"identifier\": \"0\", \"name\": \"section heading\", \"position\": 0, \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"headline\": \"\", \"text\": \"\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": [{\"position\": 0, \"identifier\": \"1\", \"text\": \"<p><b>Neonatal herpes is a herpes infection in a young baby.
