The lack of melanin in your skin can turn the hair in the affected area white or grey.</p>\\n<p>Vitiligo often starts as a pale patch of skin that gradually turns completely white. The centre of a patch may be white, with paler skin around it. If there are blood vessels under the skin, the patch may be slightly pink, rather than white.</p>\\n<p>The edges of the patch may be smooth or irregular.

Melanin is produced by skin cells called melanocytes, and it gives your skin its colour.</p>\\n<p>In vitiligo, there are not enough working melanocytes to produce enough melanin in your skin. This causes white patches to develop on your skin or hair.\\u00a0It's not clear exactly why the melanocytes disappear from the affected areas of skin.</p>\\n<h3>Autoimmune conditions</h3>\\n<p>Non-segmental vitiligo (the most common type) is thought to be an autoimmune condition.</p>\\n<p>In autoimmune conditions, the immune system does not work properly. Instead of attacking foreign cells, such as viruses, your immune system attacks your body's healthy cells and tissue.</p>\\n<p>If you have non-segmental vitiligo, your immune system destroys the melanocyte skin cells that make melanin.</p>\\n<p>Vitiligo\\u00a0is also associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/overactive-thyroid-hyperthyroidism/\\\">hyperthyroidism</a> (an overactive thyroid gland),\\u00a0but not everyone with vitiligo will develop these conditions.</p>\\n<h3>Risk factors</h3>\\n<p>You may be at increased risk of developing non-segmental vitiligo if:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>other members of your family have it </li>\\n<li>there's a family history of other autoimmune conditions \\u2013 for example, if one of your parents has pernicious anaemia (an autoimmune condition that affects the stomach) </li>\\n<li>you have another autoimmune condition  </li>\\n<li>you have <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/melanoma-skin-cancer/\\\">melanoma</a> (a type of skin cancer) or <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/non-hodgkin-lymphoma/\\\">non-Hodgkin lymphoma</a> (cancer of the lymphatic system)  </li>\\n<li>you have particular changes in your genes that are known to be linked to non-segmental vitiligo </li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Neurochemicals</h3>\\n<p>Segmental vitiligo (the less common type) is thought to be caused by chemicals released from the nerve endings in your skin. These chemicals are poisonous to the melanocyte skin cells. </p>\\n<h3>Triggers</h3>\\n<p>It's possible that vitiligo may be triggered by particular events, such as: </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>stressful events, such as childbirth </li>\\n<li>skin damage, such as severe sunburn or cuts (this is known as the Koebner response) </li>\\n<li>exposure to certain chemicals \\u2013\\u00a0for example, at work </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Vitiligo is not caused by an infection and you cannot catch it from someone else who has it.</p>\\n\", \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"name\": \"markdown\"}]}, {\"identifier\": \"0\", \"name\": \"section heading\", \"position\": 3, \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"headline\": \"\", \"text\": \"Diagnosing vitiligo\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": [{\"position\": 0, \"identifier\": \"1\", \"text\": \"<h2>Diagnosing vitiligo</h2>\\n<p>A GP will be able to diagnose vitiligo after examining the affected areas of skin.</p>\\n<p>They may ask you if:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>there's a history of vitiligo in your family </li>\\n<li>there's a history of other autoimmune conditions in your family\\u00a0 </li>\\n<li>you've injured the affected areas of skin \\u2013\\u00a0for example, whether you've had\\u00a0sunburn or a severe rash there </li>\\n<li>you tan easily in the sun, or whether you burn\\u00a0 </li>\\n<li>any areas of skin have got better without treatment, or whether they're getting worse </li>\\n<li>you've tried any treatments already </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>A GP may also ask you about the impact vitiligo has on your life.

This usually involves:</p><ul><li>stopping treatment\\u00a0with cyclophosphamide</li><li>taking\\u00a0medicine that helps &quot;calm&quot; (or control) your body&#x27;s immune system, such as an immunosuppressant like <a href=\\\"/medicines/methotrexate/\\\">methotrexate</a> or <a href=\\\"/medicines/azathioprine/\\\">azathioprine</a></li><li>taking steroid tablets every day</li></ul><p>This stage of treatment typically lasts for 2 to 5 years.</p><h4>Stage 3: Treating\\u00a0symptoms if they come back</h4><p>If your symptoms come back or you\\u00a0get new symptoms (a relapse) at any point, your treatment may be changed or restarted.</p><p>For example, your dose of steroids may be increased, and you may need to have more cyclophosphamide injections, start treatment with rituximab, or possibly have a course of plasma exchange.</p>\", \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"name\": \"markdown\"}]}, {\"identifier\": \"0\", \"name\": \"section heading\", \"position\": 5, \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"headline\": \"\", \"text\": \"Living\\u00a0with GPA\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": [{\"position\": 0, \"identifier\": \"1\", \"text\": \"<h2>Living\\u00a0with GPA</h2><p>GPA is a serious condition but, with treatment, it can usually be kept under control.</p><p>You might need to take medicine for several years and you&#x27;ll have regular check-ups in case your symptoms come back.</p><p>About\\u00a0half of people with GPA have a relapse\\u00a0within a few years\\u00a0of their treatment stopping.
