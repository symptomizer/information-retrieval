commonly used to treat BDD.</p><p>It may take up to 12 weeks for SSRIs to have an effect on your BDD symptoms.</p><p>If they work for you, you&#x27;ll probably be asked to keep taking them for several months to improve your symptoms further and stop them coming back.</p><p>There are some common <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/ssri-antidepressants/side-effects/\\\">side effects of taking SSRIs</a>, but these will often pass within a few weeks.</p><p>Your doctor will keep a close eye on you over the first few weeks. It&#x27;s important to tell them if you&#x27;re feeling particularly anxious or emotional, or are having thoughts of harming yourself.</p><p>If you&#x27;ve not had symptoms for 6 to 12 months, you&#x27;ll probably be taken off SSRIs.</p><p>This will be done by slowly reducing your dose over time to help make sure your symptoms do not come back (relapse) and to avoid any side effects of coming off the drug (withdrawal symptoms), such as anxiety.</p><p>Adults younger than 30 will need to be carefully monitored when taking SSRIs as they may have a higher chance of developing suicidal thoughts or trying to hurt themselves in the early stages of treatment.</p><p>Children and young people may be offered an SSRI if they&#x27;re having severe symptoms of BDD.</p><p>Medicine should only be suggested after they have seen a psychiatrist and been offered therapy.</p><h3>Further treatment</h3><p>If treatment with both CBT and an SSRI has not improved your BDD symptoms after 12 weeks, you may be prescribed a different type of SSRI or another antidepressant called clomipramine.</p><p>If you do not see any improvements in your symptoms, you may be referred to a mental health clinic or hospital that specialises in BDD, such as the National OCD/BDD Service in London.</p><p>These services will probably do a more in-depth assessment of your BDD.</p><p>They may offer you more CBT or a

</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>beta-2 agonists, such as\\u00a0<a href=\\\"/medicines/salbutamol-inhaler/\\\">salbutamol</a>, salmeterol, formoterol and vilanterol </li>\\n<li>anticholinergics, such as\\u00a0ipratropium, tiotropium, aclidinium and glycopyrronium </li>\\n<li>theophylline</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Beta-2 agonists and anticholinergics are available in both short-acting and long-acting forms, whereas theophylline is only available in a long-acting form.</p>\\n<h3>Beta-2 agonists</h3>\\n<p>Beta-2 agonists are used for both asthma and COPD, although some types are only available for COPD. </p>\\n<p>They're usually inhaled using a small handheld inhaler, but may also be\\u00a0available as tablets or syrup. </p>\\n<p>For sudden, severe symptoms, they can also be injected or nebulised. </p>\\n<p>A nebuliser is a compressor that turns liquid medication into a fine mist, allowing a large dose of the medicine to be inhaled through a mouthpiece or face mask.</p>\\n<p>Beta-2 agonists work by stimulating receptors called beta-2 receptors in the muscles that line the airways, which causes them to relax and allows the airways to widen (dilate).</p>\\n<p>They should be used with caution in people with: </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>an overactive thyroid <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/overactive-thyroid-hyperthyroidism/\\\">(hyperthyroidism)</a> \\u2013\\u00a0a condition that occurs when there's too much thyroid hormone in the body </li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/cardiovascular-disease/\\\">cardiovascular

lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>In rare cases, beta-2 agonists can make some of the symptoms and possible complications of these conditions worse.</p>\\n<h3>Anticholinergics</h3>\\n<p>Anticholinergics (also known as antimuscarinics) are mainly used to treat COPD, but a few can also be used for asthma. </p>\\n<p>They're usually taken using an inhaler, but may\\u00a0be nebulised to treat sudden and severe symptoms.</p>\\n<p>Anticholinergics cause the airways to widen by blocking the cholinergic nerves. </p>\\n<p>These nerves release chemicals that can cause the muscles lining the airways to tighten.</p>\\n<p>They\\u00a0should be used with caution in people with:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/prostate-enlargement/\\\">benign prostate enlargement</a>\\u00a0\\u2013\\u00a0where the prostate gland becomes enlarged, which can affect how you pee

pressure in the eye </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>If you have benign prostate enlargement or a bladder outflow obstruction, anticholinergics can cause problems, such as difficulty peeing and not being able to empty your bladder fully.</p>\\n<p>Glaucoma can\\u00a0get worse if\\u00a0anticholinergic medication unintentionally gets into the eyes.</p>\\n<h3>Theophylline</h3>\\n<p>Theophylline is usually taken in tablet or capsule form, but\\u00a0a different version called aminophylline can be given directly\\u00a0into a vein (intravenously) if your symptoms are severe.</p>\\n<p>It's unclear exactly how theophylline works, but\\u00a0it seems to reduce any inflammation (swelling) in the airways, in addition to relaxing the muscles lining them.</p>\\n<p>The effect of theophylline is weaker\\u00a0than other bronchodilators and corticosteroids. </p>\\n<p>It's also more likely to cause side effects, so is often only used alongside these medicines if they're not effective enough.</p>\\n<p>Theophylline should be used with caution in people with:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>an overactive thyroid </li>\\n<li>cardiovascular disease </li>\\n<li>liver problems, such as <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/liver-disease/\\\">liver disease</a></li>\\n<li>high blood pressure </li>\\n<li>open sores that develop on the stomach lining <a

href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/epilepsy/\\\">(epilepsy)</a>\\u00a0</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Theophylline may make these conditions worse. In people with liver problems, it can sometimes lead to a dangerous build-up of medication in the body.</p>\\n<p>Other medicines can also cause an abnormal build-up of theophylline in the body. This should always be checked by your doctor.</p>\\n<p>Elderly people may also need additional monitoring while taking theophylline.</p>\\n\", \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"name\": \"markdown\"}]},

All of these are risk factors for CVD.</p><p>Exercising regularly will help keep your heart healthy. When combined with a healthy diet, exercise can also help you maintain a healthy weight.</p><h3>Being overweight or obese</h3><p>Being overweight or obese increases your risk of developing diabetes and high blood pressure, both of which are risk factors for CVD.</p><p>You&#x27;re at an increased risk of CVD if:</p><ul><li>your <a href=\\\"/common-health-questions/lifestyle/what-is-the-body-mass-index-bmi/\\\">body mass index (BMI)</a>\\u00a0is\\u00a025 or above\\u00a0\\u2013 use the\\u00a0<a href=\\\"/live-well/healthy-weight/bmi-calculator/\\\">BMI healthy weight calculator</a> to work out your BMI</li><li>you&#x27;re a man with a waist measurement\\u00a0of\\u00a094cm\\u00a0(about 37 inches) or more, or a woman with a waist measurement\\u00a0of\\u00a080cm (about 31.5 inches)\\u00a0or more</li></ul><p>Read more about <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/obesity/\\\">obesity</a>.</p><h3>Family history of CVD</h3><p>If you have a family history of CVD, your risk of developing it is also increased.</p><p>You&#x27;re considered to have a family history of CVD if either:</p><ul><li>your father or brother were diagnosed with CVD before they were 55</li><li>your mother or sister were diagnosed with CVD before they were 65</li></ul><p>Tell your doctor or nurse if you have a family history of CVD. They may suggest checking your blood pressure and cholesterol level.</p><h3>Ethnic background</h3><p>In the UK,\\u00a0CVD is more common in people of south Asian and an African or Caribbean background.</p><p>This is because people from these backgrounds are more likely to have other risk factors for CVD, such as high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes.</p><p></p><h3>Other risk factors</h3><p>Other factors that affect your risk of developing CVD include:</p><ul><li>age \\u2013 CVD is most common in people over 50 and your risk of developing it increases as you get older</li><li>gender \\u2013 men are more likely to develop CVD at an earlier age than women</li><li>diet \\u2013 an unhealthy diet can\\u00a0lead to\\u00a0high cholesterol and high blood pressure</li><li>alcohol \\u2013\\u00a0excessive\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/alcohol-support/\\\">alcohol</a> consumption can also increase your cholesterol and blood pressure levels, and contribute to weight gain</li></ul>\", \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"name\": \"markdown\"}]}, {\"identifier\": \"0\", \"name\": \"section heading\", \"position\": 5, \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"headline\": \"\", \"text\": \"Preventing\\u00a0CVD\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": [{\"position\": 0, \"identifier\": \"1\", \"text\": \"<h2>Preventing\\u00a0CVD</h2><p>A healthy lifestyle can\\u00a0lower your risk of CVD.

to a specialist called a rheumatologist.</p><p>Having too many corticosteroid injections can damage your costochondral joint, so you may only be able to have this type of treatment once every few months if you continue to experience pain.</p><h3>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)</h3><p>TENS is a method of pain relief where a mild electric current is delivered to the affected area using a small battery-operated device.\\u00a0</p><p>The electrical impulses can reduce the pain signals going to the spinal cord and brain, which may help relieve pain and relax muscles.</p><p>They may also stimulate the production of endorphins, which are the body&#x27;s natural painkillers.</p><p>Although TENS may be used to help relieve pain in a wide range of conditions, it does not work for everyone.</p><p>There&#x27;s not enough good-quality scientific evidence to say for sure whether TENS is a reliable method of pain relief.</p><p>Speak to a GP if you&#x27;re considering TENS.</p><p><a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/transcutaneous-electrical-nerve-stimulation-tens/\\\">Find out more about transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation

One is connected to the functioning part of your bowel,\\u00a0where waste leaves your body after the operation.</p><p>The other opening is connected to the inactive part of your bowel, leading to your anus.</p><p>In some cases, a support device (a rod or bridge) may be used to hold the loop of colon in place while it heals. It&#x27;s usually removed after a few days.</p><h3>End colostomy</h3><p>With an end colostomy, 1 end of the colon is pulled out through a cut in your tummy and stitched to the skin to create a stoma.</p><p>An end colostomy is often permanent. Temporary end colostomies are sometimes used in emergencies.</p><h3>The stoma</h3><p>The position of the stoma will depend on the section of your colon that&#x27;s diverted, but it&#x27;s usually on the left-hand side of your tummy, below your waist.</p><p>If the operation is planned in advance, you&#x27;ll meet a specialist stoma nurse to discuss the positioning of the stoma.</p><p>The stoma will be red and moist and may bleed slightly, particularly in the beginning\\u00a0\\u2013 this is normal.

\"identifier\": \"1\", \"text\": \"<h2>Types of CJD</h2>\\n<p>There are 4 main types of CJD, which are described below.</p>\\n<h3>Sporadic CJD</h3>\\n<p>Sporadic CJD is the most common type.</p>\\n<p>The precise cause of sporadic CJD is unclear, but it's been suggested that a normal brain protein changes abnormally (\\\"misfolds\\\") and turns into a prion.</p>\\n<p>Most cases of sporadic CJD occur in adults aged between 45 and 75.\\u00a0On average, symptoms develop between the ages of 60 and 65.</p>\\n<p>Despite being the most common type of CJD, sporadic CJD is still very rare, affecting only 1 or 2 people in every million each year in the UK.</p>\\n<p>In 2014, there were 90 recorded deaths from sporadic CJD in the UK. </p>\\n<h3>Variant CJD</h3>\\n<p>Variant CJD (vCJD) is likely to be caused by consuming meat from a cow that had\\u00a0bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or \\\"mad cow\\\" disease),\\u00a0a similar prion disease to CJD.</p>\\n<p>Since the link between variant CJD and BSE was discovered in 1996, strict controls have proved very effective in preventing meat from infected cattle entering the food chain. </p>\\n<p>See\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease-cjd/prevention/\\\">preventing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</a>\\u00a0for more information.</p>\\n<p>But the average time it takes for the symptoms of variant CJD to occur after initial infection (the incubation period) is still unclear. </p>\\n<p>The incubation period could be very long (more than 10 years) in some people, so those exposed to infected meat before the food controls were introduced can still develop variant CJD.</p>\\n<p>The prion that causes variant CJD can also be transmitted by <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/blood-transfusion/\\\">blood transfusion</a>, although this has only happened 4 times in the UK.</p>\\n<p>In 2014, there were no recorded deaths from variant CJD in the UK.</p>\\n<h3>Familial or inherited CJD</h3>\\n<p>Familial CJD is a very rare genetic condition where one of the genes a person inherits from\\u00a0their parent (the prion protein gene) carries a mutation that causes prions to form in their brain\\u00a0during adulthood, triggering the symptoms of CJD. </p>\\n<p>It affects about 1 in every 9 million people in the UK.</p>\\n<p>The symptoms of\\u00a0familial CJD usually first develop in\\u00a0people when they're in their early 50s. </p>\\n<p>In\\u00a02014, there\\u00a0were 10 deaths\\u00a0from familial CJD and similar inherited prion diseases in the UK.</p>\\n<h3>Iatrogenic CJD</h3>\\n<p>Iatrogenic CJD is where the infection is accidentally spread from someone with CJD through medical or surgical treatment.</p>\\n<p>For example, a common cause of iatrogenic CJD in the past was growth hormone treatment using human pituitary growth hormones extracted from deceased individuals, some of whom were infected with CJD. </p>\\n<p>Synthetic versions of human growth hormone have been used since 1985, so this is no longer a risk. </p>\\n<p>Iatrogenic CJD can also occur if instruments used during brain surgery on a person with CJD aren't properly cleaned between each surgical procedure and are reused on another person. </p>\\n<p>But increased awareness of these risks means iatrogenic CJD is now very rare. </p>\\n<p>In 2014, there were 3 deaths from iatrogenic CJD in the UK caused by\\u00a0receiving human growth hormone before 1985.</p>\\n\", \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"name\": \"markdown\"}]},

Some examples are:</p><h3>Usual female pattern genes with genitals that look different to girls&#x27; genitals</h3><p>Some people have XX (usual female) chromosomes with ovaries and a womb, but their genitals may not look the same as many females.</p><p>For example, they may have a more developed clitoris and their vagina may be closed.</p><p>Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XX DSD.</p><p>The most common cause is <a href=\\\"https://www.gosh.nhs.uk/conditions-and-treatments/conditions-we-treat/congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-cah\\\">congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)</a>. A person who has CAH lacks an enzyme (chemical substance) that their body needs to make the hormones cortisol and aldosterone.</p><p>Without these hormones, their body produces more androgens (sex hormones that are naturally higher in males). If the child is female, the raised androgen levels before birth can cause their genitals to look different, such as a larger clitoris and a vagina that is not open in the usual place.</p><p>CAH can also cause serious health issues, such as life-threatening kidney problems that need to be treated as soon as possible.</p><p>Find more information and advice from the <a href=\\\"http://www.livingwithcah.com/\\\">CAH support group</a>.</p><h3>Genes usually seen in males with genitals that look the same as most girls&#x27; and some internal male structures</h3><p>Some people have XY (male) chromosomes, but their external genitals may develop in the usual way for girls or boys.</p><p>Sometimes it&#x27;s difficult at first to know whether their genitals are more similar to girls&#x27; or boys&#x27;. A person may have a womb and may also have testicles inside their body. Sometimes the testicles might not work properly.</p><p>Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XY DSD.</p><p>Many people with 46,XY DSD are boys born with the opening to pass urine towards the bottom of their penis or below it.</p><p>For some, the scrotum appears separated into two smaller sacs, one on either side. Doctors call this peno-scrotal hypospadias and boys and men with this DSD can have either fully developed or partially developed testes.</p><p>There are several causes of 46,XY DSD. One possible cause is <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/androgen-insensitivity-syndrome/\\\">androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)</a>, where the body &quot;ignores&quot; androgens or is insensitive to them.</p><p>Sometimes a person&#x27;s body does not respond at all or only partly responds to androgens.</p><p>Complete insensitivity to androgens makes a person with XY chromosomes female. Partial insensitivity to androgens can mean that some people are male and others are female.</p><p>Find support and more information about AIS from <a href=\\\"https://dsdfamilies.org/\\\">DSD Families</a> or the <a href=\\\"http://www.aissg.org\\\">AIS Support Group</a>.</p><h3>Ordinary looking genitals but different sex development</h3><p>Some people have a chromosome pattern other than the usual XY or XX. They may have one X chromosome (XO), or they may have an extra chromosome (XXY).</p><p>Their internal and external sex organs can be either male or female, but they may not go through a full physical development at puberty. For example, a child with female sex organs may not start having <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/periods/\\\">periods</a>.</p><p>Doctors call this sex chromosome DSD.</p><p>One type is <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/klinefelters-syndrome/\\\">Klinefelter syndrome</a>, which is where a boy is born with an extra X chromosome (XXY).</p><p>This can mean they do not produce the usual level of testosterone, the sex hormone responsible for the development of male characteristics, such as the testes and body hair. Testosterone is also important for bone strength and fertility in men.</p><p>Find more information and support about <a href=\\\"https://www.ksa-uk.net/\\\">Klinefelter syndrome</a>.</p><p>Another example of this type of DSD is <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/turner-syndrome/\\\">Turner syndrome</a>, which is where a girl is born with a missing X chromosome.</p><p>Girls and women with Turner syndrome are often <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/infertility/\\\">infertile</a> and their height may be shorter than average.</p><p>Find support and more information about <a href=\\\"https://tss.org.uk/\\\">Turner Syndrome</a>.</p><h3>Female with usual external genitals, but without a womb</h3><p>Some females are born with an underdeveloped womb or without a womb, cervix and upper vagina. The ovaries and external genitalia look the same as most girls and women and they develop breasts and pubic hair as they get older.</p><p>This is called Rokitansky syndrome. It&#x27;s also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-K\\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH syndrome). The cause is not clear, but girls and women with Rokitansky syndrome/MRKH have XX chromosomes.</p><p>Often the first sign of Rokitansky syndrome is that a girl does not start having periods. Sex involving the vagina may also be difficult because the vagina may be shorter than most women&#x27;s.</p><p>Not having a womb means that a woman cannot become pregnant, but it&#x27;s sometimes possible to take eggs from their ovaries, fertilise them, and implant them in another woman&#x27;s womb (surrogacy).</p><p>For support and more information about Rokitansky syndrome at:</p><ul><li><a href=\\\"http://www.mrkh.org.uk/index.html\\\">MRKH UK</a></li><li><a href=\\\"http://livingmrkh.org.uk/\\\">Living MRKH</a></li><li><a href=\\\"https://dsdfamilies.org/\\\">DSD Families</a></li></ul><h3>Sex characteristics usually seen in males or females</h3><p>Some people with a very rare type of DSD have both ovarian and testicular tissue (sometimes one ovary and one testis). Their genitals may appear female or male or could look different from either.</p><p>Most people with this type of DSD have XX (female) chromosomes. The cause is not usually clear, but some people with the condition have been found to have genetic material that&#x27;s usually seen on the Y chromosome appearing on their X chromosome.</p><p>Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XX ovotesticular DSD.</p>\", \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"name\": \"markdown\"}]}, {\"identifier\": \"0\", \"name\": \"section heading\", \"position\": 2, \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"headline\": \"\", \"text\": \"What\\u00a0happens after birth\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": [{\"position\": 0, \"identifier\": \"1\", \"text\": \"<h2>What happens after the birth of a baby</h2><p>Sometimes doctors check a baby for DSD soon after birth because of signs such as undescended testicles or if a baby&#x27;s genitals look different.</p><p>Tests may be done to help get a clear diagnosis and find out whether any immediate treatment is needed.</p><p>Tests may include:</p><ul><li>a further physical examination of your baby done by a specialist</li><li>an <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/ultrasound-scan/\\\">ultrasound scan</a> to examine their internal organs</li><li><a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/blood-tests/\\\">blood tests</a> to check their genes and hormone levels</li></ul><p>Your care team may advise you to delay registering your child&#x27;s birth for a few days until the tests are complete, you have discussed the results with your child&#x27;s care team and the sex of your baby is established or decided.</p><p>Many forms of DSD do not require any medical care other than understanding the baby&#x27;s development and knowing what to expect as they grow older.</p><p>A specialist nurse in your care team can help you learn about DSD and a psychologist will help you address any concerns you have.</p><p>You can find more information about\\u202fwhat happens when your baby is born with genitals that look different in the <a href=\\\"https://dsdfamilies.org/resources\\\">First Days leaflet</a> from DSD Families.</p>\", \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"name\": \"markdown\"}]}, {\"identifier\": \"0\", \"name\": \"section heading\", \"position\": 3, \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"headline\": \"\", \"text\": \"Advice\\u00a0for parents of older children\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": [{\"position\": 0, \"identifier\": \"1\", \"text\": \"<h2>Advice\\u00a0for parents of older children</h2><p>Sometimes a DSD may be diagnosed if an older child does not go through puberty properly.

People with diabetes are at risk of an eye problem called diabetic retinopathy. This can lead to sight loss if it's not treated.</strong></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/diabetic-retinopathy/\\\">Diabetic retinopathy</a> is one of the most common causes of sight loss among adults.</p>\\n<p>It occurs when the small blood vessels in the part of the eye called the retina are damaged.</p>\\n<p>You should still see your optician every 2 years for an eye test. Diabetic eye screening is only for diabetic retinopathy and does not check for other eye problems.</p>\\n<h2>Why eye screening is needed</h2>\\n<p>Screening can spot the diabetic retinopathy before you notice any changes to your vision. It doesn't usually cause any symptoms in the early stages.</p>\\n<p>If it\\u2019s found early enough, treatment may stop it getting worse. </p>\\n<p>It can be much harder to treat if it\\u2019s not found until it causes symptoms. </p>\\n<p>The test takes about 30 minutes and involves looking at the back of the eye and taking pictures of it.</p>\\n<h2>When diabetic eye screening is offered</h2>\\n<p>Everyone with diabetes who is 12 years of age or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year.</p>\\n<p>You should receive a letter from your local Diabetic Eye Screening Service asking you if you want to have a screening test. The letter will include a <a href=\\\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/diabetic-eye-screening-description-in-brief \\u201cExternal website\\u201d\\\">leaflet about diabetic eye screening</a>.</p>\\n<p>People with diabetes can opt out of the screening programme if they choose. They should confirm this in writing to the screening service that has asked them to have screening</p>\\n<p>Contact your local screening service or your GP if you haven't had a letter and your screening test is overdue. You can <a href=\\\"/Service-Search/Diabetic-eye-screening/LocationSearch/1911\\\">look up your local screening service</a> \\u2013 your service will be the one nearest to your GP practice.</p>\\n<p>The letter will say where you need to go. This may be your GP practice, your local hospital, a local opticians, or a nearby clinic.</p>\\n<p>Bring all the glasses and contact lenses you wear, along with lens solution for contacts.</p>\\n<p>If you have sight problems in between screening tests, such as sudden vision loss or a vision that\\u2019s getting worse, seek urgent medical advice. Don't wait until your next screening test.</p>\\n<h2>Diabetic eye screening in pregnancy</h2>\\n<p>If you have diabetes and become pregnant, you'll need special care as there are risks to both mother and baby linked with the condition.</p>\\n<p>You'll be offered extra eye checks at or soon after your first antenatal clinic visit, and also after 28 weeks of pregnancy.</p>\\n<p>If the early stages of retinopathy are found at the first screening, you'll also be offered another test between 16 and 20 weeks of pregnancy.</p>\\n<p>If serious problems are found at any screening, you'll be referred to an eye specialist.</p>\\n<p>Some women who don't have diabetes can develop high blood sugar during pregnancy. This is known as <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/gestational-diabetes/\\\">gestational diabetes</a>.</p>\\n<p>Pregnant women who get gestational diabetes aren't asked if they want to have diabetic eye screening.</p>\\n<h2>What happens during diabetic eye screening</h2>\\n<p>The screening appointment should last about 30 minutes.</p>\\n<p>When you arrive, the test will be explained to you. If you have any questions, ask the person who is treating you.</p>\\n<p>You'll be given eye drops to make your pupils bigger, which takes between 15 and 20 minutes, and pictures of your retina will be taken.</p>\\n<p>There will be a flash of light each time a picture is taken, but the camera won't touch your eye. Although the light is bright, it shouldn't hurt.</p>\\n<p>The eye drops may cause your eyes to sting slightly, and after about 15 minutes your vision will be blurred. You may find it hard to focus on objects that are close to you.</p>\\n<p>The blurring can last 2 to 6 hours. You won't be able to drive home after the test, so you may want to bring someone with you.</p>\\n<p>After the test, you may also find that things looks very bright. You may want to take a pair of sunglasses to wear on the way home.</p>\\n<h3>Side effects</h3>\\n<p>In very rare cases, the eye drops can cause a sudden pressure increase within the eye. This needs to be treated quickly at an eye unit.</p>\\n<p>The symptoms of a pressure increase are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>pain in your eye</li>\\n<li>redness of the white of your eye</li>\\n<li>blurred vision, sometimes with rainbow halos around lights, which doesn\\u2019t get better in a few hours</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>If you experience any of these symptoms after screening, go back to the screening centre or your nearest A&amp;E department.</p>\\n<h2>Your screening results</h2>\\n<p>Within 6 weeks, both you and your GP should get a letter letting you know your results.</p>\\n<p>You won't get the results straight away, as the pictures need to be studied carefully.</p>\\n<p>The screening results may show either:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>no retinopathy</li>\\n<li>background retinopathy \\u2013 also called stage 1 retinopathy</li>\\n<li>degrees of referable retinopathy \\u2013 this means retinopathy that requires referral to an eye specialist for further tests and treatment</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>You may need to have further tests if:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>the pictures aren't clear enough to give a result</li>\\n<li>you have retinopathy that could affect your sight and treatment is needed</li>\\n<li>you have retinopathy that needs to be checked more than once a year</li>\\n<li>other eye conditions are found, such as <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/glaucoma/\\\">glaucoma</a> or <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/cataracts/\\\">cataracts</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>If your results show no retinopathy or background retinopathy, you'll be asked to come back for another screening test a year later.</p>\\n<p>You can also reduce your risk of getting diabetic retinopathy in the future by controlling your blood sugar levels and blood pressure.</p>\\n<p>Read more about <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/diabetic-retinopathy/prevention/\\\">preventing diabetic retinopathy</a>.</p>\\n<p>If screening finds a problem that could affect your sight, you'll be told about the types of treatment that can help.</p>\\n<p>Read about the <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/diabetic-retinopathy/treatment/\\\">treatment options for diabetic retinopathy</a>.</p>\\n<p>If you have questions about your results, contact your local diabetic eye screening service.
