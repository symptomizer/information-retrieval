too unwell to have surgery. </p>\n<p>This is where a needle is inserted through your tummy to drain away the fluid that's built up in the gallbladder.</p>\n<p>If you're fit enough to have surgery, your doctors will decide when the best time to remove your gallbladder is. </p>\n<p>In some cases you may need to have surgery immediately or in the next day or 2, or it may be necessary to\u00a0wait a few weeks until the inflammation has settled down.</p>\n<p>Surgery can be carried out in 3 ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a

special surgical instruments inserted through a number of small cuts in your abdomen </li>\n<li>single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy \u2013 where the gallbladder is removed through a single cut, which is usually made near the bellybutton </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/gallbladder-removal/what-happens/#open\">open\u00a0cholecystectomy</a>\u00a0\u2013 where the gallbladder is removed through a single larger cut in the tummy </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although some people who have had their gallbladder removed have reported symptoms of bloating and <a href=\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/diarrhoea/\">diarrhoea</a> after eating certain foods, it's possible to lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder. </p>\n<p>The organ can be useful, but
