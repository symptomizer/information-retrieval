This is usually painless, and can be used for temporary relief in people who are not able to have other treatments.</p>\\n<h3>Surgery</h3>\\n<p>Under general anaesthetic, the muscle fibres in the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach are cut. This is done using keyhole surgery (<a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/laparoscopy/\\\">laparoscopy</a>) and is called Heller\\u2019s Myotomy. </p>\\n<p>It can permanently make swallowing easier. </p>\\n<p>Often a second procedure will be done at the same time to stop you getting <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/heartburn-and-acid-reflux/\\\">acid reflux and heartburn</a>, which can be a side-effect of the Heller\\u2019s Myotomy operation. Your surgeon will talk to you about this. </p>\\n<p>In very rare cases some people may need an operation to remove a part of their oesophagus. </p>\\n<h3>Follow-up treatment</h3>\\n<p>Balloon dilation and surgery can both cause side effects such as <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/heartburn-and-acid-reflux/\\\">acid reflux and heartburn</a> and chest pain. Your GP may be able to prescribe medication to help with this, and your surgeon may suggest you take this medication routinely. </p>\\n<p>Read more about <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/heartburn-and-acid-reflux/treatment/\\\">treatments for acid reflux and heartburn</a>. </p>\\n<p>It's normal for chest pain to persist for a while after treatment.

But sometimes the tumour is too large to be removed entirely, and you may need another operation or further treatment with medicine or radiotherapy.</p><p>Under <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/general-anaesthesia/\\\">general anaesthetic</a>, the surgeon will make a small cut inside your nose or behind your upper lip to access the pituitary gland.</p><p>A long, thin, flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end, called an <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/endoscopy/\\\">endoscope</a>, is fed into the opening so your doctor can see the tumour.

Speak to your doctor about the options available to you, and the benefits and risks of each.</p><h3>Radiotherapy</h3><p>If surgery is not possible,\\u00a0or not all of\\u00a0the tumour could be removed, or if medicine has not worked, you may be offered <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/radiotherapy/\\\">radiotherapy</a>.</p><p>This can eventually reduce your growth hormone levels, but it may not have a noticeable effect for several years and you may need to take medicine in the meantime.</p><p>2 main types of radiotherapy are used to treat acromegaly:</p><ul><li><b>stereotactic radiotherapy</b> \\u2013 a high-dose beam of radiation is aimed very precisely at your adenoma; you&#x27;ll need to wear a rigid head frame or a plastic mask to hold your head still during the treatment, which can usually be done in one session</li><li><b>conventional radiotherapy</b> \\u2013 this also\\u00a0uses a\\u00a0beam of radiation to target the adenoma, but it&#x27;s wider and less precise than the one used\\u00a0in stereotactic radiotherapy; this means this treatment can damage the surrounding pituitary gland and brain tissue, so it&#x27;s given in small doses over 4 to 6 weeks to\\u00a0give your tissues time to heal between treatments</li></ul><p>Stereotactic radiotherapy is more commonly used to treat adenomas because it minimises the risk of damage to nearby healthy tissue.</p><p>Radiotherapy can have a number of side effects. It will often cause a gradual drop in the levels of other hormones produced by your pituitary gland, so you&#x27;ll usually need\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt/\\\">hormone replacement therapy</a> for the rest of your life. It may also have an effect on your fertility.</p><p>Your doctor will be able to talk to you about these risks and other possible side effects.</p><h3>Follow-up</h3><p>Treatment is often effective at stopping the excessive production of growth hormone and improving the symptoms of acromegaly.</p><p>After treatment, you&#x27;ll need regular follow-up appointments with your specialist for the rest of your life. These will be used to monitor how well your pituitary gland is working, check you&#x27;re on the correct hormone replacement treatment and make sure the condition does not return.</p>\", \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"name\": \"markdown\"}]}, {\"identifier\": \"0\", \"name\": \"section heading\", \"position\": 5, \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"headline\": \"Diagnosing acromegaly\", \"text\": \"\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": [{\"position\": 0, \"identifier\": \"1\", \"text\": \"<p>Because the symptoms of acromegaly often develop gradually over several years, you may not get a diagnosis straight away.

Others have described constant severe pain.</p>\\n<h3>Treating stump and phantom limb pain</h3>\\n<p>Stump and phantom limb pain will usually improve over time, but treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms.</p>\\n<h4>Medicines</h4>\\n<p>Medicines that may be used to help\\u00a0relieve pain include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/nsaids/\\\">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</a>, such as <a href=\\\"/medicines/ibuprofen-for-adults/\\\">ibuprofen</a></li>\\n<li>anticonvulsants such as <a href=\\\"/medicines/carbamazepine/\\\">carbamazepine</a> or <a href=\\\"/medicines/gabapentin/\\\">gabapentin</a></li>\\n<li>antidepressants such as <a href=\\\"/medicines/amitriptyline-for-pain/\\\">amitriptyline</a>, or nortriptyline, which are useful in treating nerve pain </li>\\n<li>opioids such as <a href=\\\"/medicines/codeine/\\\">codeine</a> or <a href=\\\"/medicines/morphine/\\\">morphine</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/steroids/\\\">corticosteroid</a>\\u00a0or\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/local-anaesthesia/\\\">local anaesthetic</a> injections </li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Self-help measures and complementary therapy</h4>\\n<p>There are several non-invasive techniques that may help relieve\\u00a0pain in some people. They include:\\u00a0</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>adjusting the way your prosthesis fits to make it more comfortable. </li>\\n<li>applying heat or cold to your limb, such as using heat or ice packs, rubs and\\u00a0creams. </li>\\n<li>massage\\u00a0to increase circulation and stimulate\\u00a0muscles. </li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/acupuncture/\\\">acupuncture</a> is\\u00a0thought to stimulate the nervous system and relieve pain. </li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/transcutaneous-electrical-nerve-stimulation-tens/\\\">transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)</a>, which uses a small, battery-operated device to deliver electrical impulses to the affected area of your body, to block or reduce pain signals.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Mental imagery</h4>\\n<p>Research\\u00a0has shown\\u00a0that people who spend 40 minutes a day imagining using the part of their limb that was amputated, such as stretching out their \\\"fingers\\\" or bunching up their \\\"toes\\\", experience a reduction in pain symptoms.</p>\\n<p>This may be related to the central theory of phantom limb pain. Researchers think the brain looks to receive feedback from an amputated limb, and these mental exercises may provide an effective substitute for this missing feedback.</p>\\n<p>Another technique, known as mirror visual feedback, involves using a mirror to create a reflection of the other limb. Some people find that exercising and moving their other limb can help relieve phantom pain.</p>\\n\", \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"name\": \"markdown\"}]}, {\"identifier\": \"0\", \"name\": \"section heading\", \"position\": 8, \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"headline\": \"\", \"text\": \"Psychological impact of amputation\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": [{\"position\": 0, \"identifier\": \"1\", \"text\": \"<h2>Psychological impact of amputation</h2>\\n<p>The loss of a limb can have a considerable psychological impact.

You do not usually need to stay in hospital when you&#x27;re having chemoradiation.</p><p>In many cases, part of the chemotherapy is delivered through a small tube called a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) in your arm, which can stay in place until your\\u00a0treatment has finished.</p><p>The tube means you do not need to stay in\\u00a0hospital during each of the cycles of chemotherapy.

It&#x27;s usually only considered if the tumour is small and can be easily removed, or if chemoradiation has not worked.</p><p>If the tumour is very small, it may be cut out during a procedure called a local excision.</p><p>This is a relatively simple procedure carried out under <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/general-anaesthesia/\\\">general anaesthetic</a>, and usually only requires a stay in hospital of a few days.</p><p>If chemoradiation has not been successful or the cancer has returned after treatment, a more complex operation called an abdominoperineal resection may be recommended.</p><p>As with a local excision, this operation is carried out under general anaesthetic.</p><p>An abdominoperineal resection involves removing your anus, rectum, part of the colon, some surrounding muscle tissue, and sometimes some of the surrounding lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system) to reduce the risk of the cancer returning.</p><p>You&#x27;ll usually need to stay in hospital for a bit longer after this type of surgery.</p><p>During the operation, a permanent <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/colostomy/\\\">colostomy</a> will also be formed to allow you to pass poo.</p><p>This is where a section of the large intestine is diverted through an opening made in your tummy called a stoma.

This pattern affects boys and girls differently: girls who get the albinism gene become carriers, while boys who get it will have albinism.</p><p>When a mother is a carrier of an X-linked type of albinism, each of her daughters has a 1 in 2 chance of becoming a carrier.

Other SSRIs include <a href=\\\"/medicines/citalopram/\\\">citalopram</a> (Cipramil), paroxetine (Seroxat) and <a href=\\\"/medicines/sertraline/\\\">sertraline</a> (Lustral).</p><h3>Serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</h3><p>SNRIs are similar to SSRIs. They were designed to be a more effective antidepressant than SSRIs. However, the evidence that SNRIs are more effective in treating depression is uncertain. It seems that some people respond better to SSRIs, while others respond better to SNRIs.</p><p>Examples of SNRIs include <a href=\\\"/medicines/duloxetine/\\\">duloxetine</a> (Cymbalta and Yentreve) and <a href=\\\"/medicines/venlafaxine/\\\">venlafaxine</a> (Efexor).</p><h3>Noradrenaline and specific serotonergic antidepressants (NASSAs)</h3><p>NASSAs may be effective for some people who are unable to take SSRIs. The side effects of NASSAs are similar to those of SSRIs, but they&#x27;re thought to cause fewer sexual problems. However, they may also cause more drowsiness at first.</p><p>The main NASSA prescribed in the UK is mirtazapine (Zispin).</p><h3>Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)</h3><p>TCAs are an older type of antidepressant. They&#x27;re no longer usually recommended as the first treatment for depression because they can be more dangerous if an overdose is taken. They also cause more unpleasant side effects than SSRIs and SNRIs.</p><p>Exceptions are sometimes made for people with severe depression that fail to respond to other treatments. TCAs may also be recommended for other mental health conditions, such as OCD and bipolar disorder.</p><p>Examples of TCAs include amitriptyline (Tryptizol), clomipramine (Anafranil), imipramine (Tofranil), lofepramine (Gamanil) and nortriptyline (Allegron).</p><p>Some types of TCAs, such as amitriptyline, can also be used to treat chronic nerve pain.</p><h3>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)</h3><p>MAOIs are an older type of antidepressant that are rarely used nowadays.</p><p>They can cause potentially serious side effects so should only be prescribed by a specialist doctor.</p><p>Examples of MAOIs include tranylcypromine, phenelzine and isocarboxazid.</p>\", \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"name\": \"markdown\"}]}, {\"identifier\": \"0\", \"name\": \"section heading\", \"position\": 7, \"@type\": \"WebPageElement\", \"headline\": \"\", \"text\": \"Alternatives to antidepressants\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": [{\"position\": 0, \"identifier\": \"1\", \"text\": \"<p>Other treatments for depression include talking therapies such as <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/\\\">cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)</a>.</p><p>Increasingly, people with moderate to severe depression are treated using a combination of antidepressants and CBT.
